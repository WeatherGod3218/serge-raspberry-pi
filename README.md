Raspberry Pi software for collecting and sending data on SERGE's Probe


## Local Development

### NOTE: MAKE SURE TO USE `uv add` IN THIS PROJECT TO KEEP `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` UPDATED!
## UV Setup

Install UV on your system if not already on it. If you already have it installed, you can skip down to the Project Setup page

UV is a blazingly fast python package manager written in Rust. The Jumpstart project uses UV for speed and simplicity. Run the linked install command for your operating system

__Linux and macOS__
```
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

__Windows (Powershell)__
```
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

## UV Commands Useful For this Project

__uv sync__: UV sync serves to replace pip install -r requirements.txt. This command syncs your virtual environment to match the `pyproject.toml` file. By default, it will only copy the default dependencies for the project (found in dependencies)

__uv sync --group $GROUP__: UV sync with the added group flag will ALSO install all dependencies found in that group ALONG with the default dependencies.

__uv sync --frozen__: When reading the UV Sync, it reads ONLY the `uv.lock` file, and does not attempt to make any modifications, and failing instead. This is incredibly useful for reproducibility, which is why its used in the docker file.

__uv sync --all-groups__: UV sync, along with installing dependencies of every group

__uv add $PACKAGE__: UV serves to replace pip install $PACKAGE. It installs the most recent version of the inserted package, and adds it to the projects default dependencies

__uv add --group $GROUP $PACKAGE__: Same as UV add, but adds the package to the group instead of the default project dependencies.


## Project Setup
1. Run: `uv venv .venv --python 3.14`
2. Activate the virtual environment
    * Bash: `source .venv/bin/activate`
    * Fish: `source .venv/bin/activate.fish`
    * Windows: `.venv\Scripts\activate`
    * Other: Good luck!
3. Run: `uv sync --all-groups`
4. Run: `pre-commit install`
5. You're all set!

## Running the Application

This app is containerized through a docker file.

1. Build the docker file
```
    docker build -t serge-raspberry-pi .
```
2. Run the newly built docker on port 8000
```
    docker run -p 8000:8000 serge-raspberry-pi
```

## Docker Compose

serge-raspberry-pi also has support for Docker Compose, a extended version of docker that simplifies the steps.

(This is a really cool thing! If you use docker often, check it out!)
```
    docker compose up --build
```

### Testing

We're using the pytest framework to create tests. A good minimum coverage requirement is about <=90%.

To run the tests just run: `pytest`

`coverage.xml` and `htmlcov` should be generated. `coverage.xml` is used for Sonarqube, while `htmlcov` is a local html view into code coverage. The easiest way to view the coverage site is to enter the directory and run: `python -m http.server` and visit the site!
